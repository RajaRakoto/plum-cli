### 📌 Build

When using the **build.js** file in this boilerplate, it's important to note the significance of the **target** option. By default, if the target option is not specified in the **build.js** file, it will be set to `browser`. However, for projects utilizing the `bun.js` runtime environment, it's imperative to explicitly set the target to `bun`. This guarantees compatibility with the `bun` shell environment and prevents unexpected behavior. Furthermore, it's noteworthy that the `target` supports three possible values: `browser`, `bun`, and `node`, providing flexibility in defining the build target according to specific project requirements.
